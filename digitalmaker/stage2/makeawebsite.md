#Make a website

###Badge requirement:
Design a single page website. You can use a design tool but writing HTML code would be fine too.

##Suggested activity

*requirements: internet connection, a modern browser (like Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari). Pen and paper.

### Step 1: Plan your website. 
What is it going to be about? What should it say? What should it look like? It can be very helpful to draw the website on a sheet of paper. 

### Step 2: Make your website
A good tool for making websites is Mozilla webmaker thimble, as it lets you see both the code you are writing (on the left hand side) and what the page will look like (on the right hand side). You can use another tool if you wish.


Hopefully you have learnt a bit of HTML and what tag is in stage 1 for this badge, but these cheat sheets might come in handy:
