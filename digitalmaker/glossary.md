What does "digital maker" mean?

##bluetooth
Bluetooth is a protocol for wireless communication. Devices such as mobile phones, laptops, PCs, printers, digital cameras and video game consoles can connect to each other, and exchange information. This is done using radio waves. Bluetooth is only used for relatively short distances, like a few metres.


##computer peripherals
A peripheral is a device that is connected to a host computer, but not an integral part of it. It expands the host's capabilities but does not form part of the core computer architecture.

There are three different types of peripherals:

* Input, used to interact with, or send data to the computer (mouse, keyboards, etc.)
* Output, which provides output to the user from the computer (monitors, printers, etc.)
* Storage, which stores data processed by the computer (hard drives, flash drives, etc.)

##database
A database is a system for storing and taking care of data (any kind of information).

##event condition
(your game reacts to something that happens)

##game design
Game design refers to the idea/concept/story and gameplay of gameplay (not just the graphic design)

Game design is the design of games. It is the art of elaborating rules to facilitate interaction between players, for playful, educating or simulation purposes. 

#hardware 
computer hardware are the parts of a machine that can be seen and touched. Some examples include processor, memory, motherboard, graphics card, network card, modem, USB flash drive, hard drive.

##home network
A home network is a group of devices – such as computers, game systems, printers, and mobile devices – that connect to the Internet and each other.

##HTML
HyperText Markup Language is a markup language for creating webpages. Webpages are usually viewed in a web browser. They can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. HTML is used to mark and describe each of these kinds of content so the web browser can show them correctly. HTML is also used to add meta information to a webpage. Meta information is information about the web page. For example, the name of the person who made it. Meta information is not usually shown by web browsers.

##hyperlink
A hyperlink is a word, phrase, or image that you can click on to jump to a new document or a new section within the current document. Hyperlinks are found in nearly all Web pages, allowing users to click their way from page to page. Text hyperlinks are often blue and underlined, but don't have to be.

##internet
The Internet is a large group of computers that are connected to each other. The Internet is used to send information quickly between computers around the world. It has millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and government networks and websites, which together carry many different kinds of information and services. So in other words, the Internet is a network of networks.

##iteration
Iteration is the repetition of a function or process in a computer program. Iterations of functions are common in computer programming, since they allow multiple blocks of data to be processed in sequence. This is typically done using a "while loop" or "for loop" (see the examples below). These loops will repeat a process until a certain number or case is reached. Recursive functions also use iteration, though instead of repeating a process, the entire function repeats itself.

##LAMP
The acronym LAMP refers to first letters of the four components of an open source stack, very popular for building dynamic websites.

* L for Linux
* A for Apache
* M for mySQL
* P for php/perl/python

##live DVD
A Live DVD is a special way of creating a computer operating system so that it is able to run without installing anything on the computer first. This special operating system is used when the computer is booting up, and runs all its programs off the object it is put on. The name of the operating system usually has something to do with the object, such as "Live CD" for CDs, "Live DVD" for DVDs, or "Live USB" for USB flash drives.

##Mozilla thimble
[Thimble](https://thimble.webmaker.org/) is a free, open tool for making, hosting and sharing your own web pages. You can write and edit HTML and CSS right in the browser.

##open source
operating system / platform 
 alternative operating system

##programmable tot / turtle / toy to follow
in the Logo programming language, children where introduced to programming using a turtle that they could give instructions to, like "forward(10)" to move forward 10 steps. Robot turtles were also made and very popular. The Lego Mindstorm robot is based on the Logo Turtle.

##programming language
A programming language is a type of written language that tells computers what to do. Programming languages are used to make all computer programs and computer software. A programming language is like a set of instructions that the computer follows to do something.

##prototype
A test version of something, making a prototype helps you think about how something should work, without having to worry about actually making it work. There are different kinds of prototypes; some are more like rough drafts and some are more like the final version. When you first come up with an idea for a new product, you'll probably sketch it out so you can show people what you're thinking of. Prototypes is very useful in testing.

##psudocode
Pseudocode is a form of source code that is written for humans, not machines, to read. It is often written to show how an algorithm works.

##sensor input
A sensor is a device that measures a physical quantity and converts it into a 'signal' which can be read by an observer or by an instrument, or computer. For example, a mercury thermometer converts the measured temperature into the expansion and contraction of a liquid which can be read on a calibrated glass tube. Other types of sensors include motion sensors, visual sensors and electromagnetic sensors.

##troubleshoot
Troubleshooting is the process of diagnosing the source of a problem. It is used to fix problems with hardware, software, and many other products. The basic theory of troubleshooting is that you start with the most general (and often most obvious) possible problems, and then narrow it down to more specific issues.

##USB stick
A USB flash drive (USB stands for Universal Serial Bus) is a popular way to store digital information. Flash drives are an easy way to share data (information). They are used with devices found in homes, workplaces and schools (like computers, dvd players, video game consoles, music players, digital picture frames etc). They are called "Flash drive" because they use flash memory to store files.


##robot
A programmable machine. You probably know a few human-like robots from science fictions movies. But most robots look nothing like humans. A lot of them do work in factories. Some, like the Mars Rover, explore space.

##software
Computer software (often called just software) is made of one or more computer programs. Sometimes it means one specific program, or it can mean all the software on a computer, including the applications and the operating system. Applications are programs that do a specific thing, such as a game or a word processor. Software is the instructions that the computer follows. Before compact discs (CDs) or Internet downloads, software came on "soft media" like paper punch cards, magnetic discs or magnetic tape.

##variable
A variable is a special type of amount or quantity with an unknown value. They are often used in programming computers or in mathematical equations. In computer science, a variable does not have to be a number, it may be a string (text) value, or a date, or an amount of money, or even an object such as a picture.

##WAMP
LAMP but for Windows instead of Linux

##web hosting
A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service. It allows people and companies to make their website available on the World Wide Web. Web hosts are companies which provide space on a server which is owned or leased for use by customers. They also allow their customers to connect to the Internet.

##web server
A web server is basically a computer that is always on and always connected to the internet, so that you can host a website on it for instance.

##wireless 
The word wireless is normally used to refer to any type of electrical or electronic operation which is done without a "hard wired" connection. Wireless communication is the transfer of information over a distance without the use of wires. The distances involved may be short (when using a television remote control) or very long (thousands or even millions of kilometers for radio communications).

##X-ray Goggles
a free tool that lets you see the code behind websites and change the text, images etc to whatever you like.
