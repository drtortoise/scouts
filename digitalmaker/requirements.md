#Digital Maker
 
Note: These badge requirements are signed off with the proviso that supporting material (which it is envisaged will be created by Nesta sponsoring the badge) address these points:
 
* A glossary covering terms (including abbreviations) used in the requirements
* Information on legal expectations/requirements relating to web design
* Activities that leaders can use to deliver badge requirements, particularly (but not exclusively) for stages 1 and 2
* Clarity on what is optional in the requirements (eg. a video explanation is an optional method in stage 1 requirement 2)
* Links to further useful information eg. on the Raspberry Pi, app design, or different hardware or software that young people could use
 
It should also be made clear that this badge doesn’t have to be delivered by the leader on a section night. It could be delivered by someone else with knowledge/expertise in this area, or could be done by young people independently eg. at home.
 
##Digital Maker – Stage 1
 
To achieve this badge you need to:
 
1. Connect computer peripherals or accessories, such as a screen and keyboard, and explain what job they do.
2. Game design:
	* With a group of friends “pretend to be the game” by acting out how someone might play a game.
	* Using paper, prototype a game and explain to someone how it works. You could video this explanation.
	* Evaluate and share what you created.
3. Edit an existing website, for example by changing the design using a paper print out. You could use software such as Mozilla’s Thimble or X-Ray Goggles.
4. Play a game with a friend where one of your acts the part of a robot and the other a user.
Record on paper what sort of commands worked best, and which were hard for the “robot” to follow.
 
###Note
You can use any hardware and/or operating system available to you provided it is capable of the functionality needed to complete these requirements. You could use different hardware, operating systems or tools for different parts of this badge if you wish.
 
##Digital Maker – Stage 2
To achieve this badge you need to:
 
1. Connect two devices and exchange data between them via wireless, bluetooth or a cable.
2. Show that you can use two different platforms or operating systems.
3. Game Design:
	* Make a cartoon, animation or video of a game using a video camera or other tool.
	* Create some pseudo code to explain how some part of your game will work.
	* Design a sequence of a game, like a whole level or in-game puzzle.
4. Design a single page website. You can use a design tool but writing HTML code would be fine too.
5. Create a set of instructions for a programmable TOT, turtle or toy to follow.

###Note
Pseudo code is an instruction for the computer to follow, but is not written in a specific language.
You can use any hardware and/or operating system available to you provided it is capable of the functionality needed to complete these requirements. You could use different hardware or operating systems for different parts of this badge if you wish.
 
##Digital Maker – Stage 3
 
To achieve this badge you need to:
 
1. Show how to trouble-shoot disk drivers, hardware devices, updating software.
2. Make a prototype of a game, using a suitable tool that includes:
	* Event conditions (your game reacts to something that happens)
	* User movement controls
	* Iteration (your code or instructions are repeated)
	* Variables (for scoring, health or counting things within the game)
3. Build, design and publish a multipage website with working hyperlinks for navigation between the pages.
4. Make a robot using prebuilt components.
 
###Note
You can use any hardware and/or operating system available to you provided it is capable of the functionality needed to complete these requirements. You could use different hardware or operating systems for different parts of this badge if you wish.
 
##Digital Maker – Stage 4
 
To achieve this badge you need to:
 
1. Set up a home network and connect it to the internet.
2. Install or run an alternative operating system onto a computer or use a “Live DVD” or USB stick.
3. Game Design:
	* Build a game, which includes progression and is fun and interesting to play.
	* Get someone else to play and evaluate it.
4. Create a fully functioning website including linking to a database.
5. Make a robot using prebuilt components that respond to sensor input (for example, backing away from a wall)
 
###Note
You can use any hardware and/or operating system available to you provided it is capable of the functionality needed to complete these requirements. You could use different hardware or operating systems for different parts of this badge if you wish.
 
##Digital Maker – Stage 5
 
To achieve this badge you need to:

1. Install on a Computer or other device the software to run a web server and host a webpage
2. Make a game or app that serves a purpose. It should:
	* Have a clear objective
	* Be challenging for the user
	* Have a clear sense of progression
	* Keep score
	* Offer a reward to the user for playing (for example the score could unlock levels or
icons)
3. Make a website that serves a purpose.
4. Use off-the-shelf components to make a robot that responds to the environment (for example a robot that react to light, its proximity to other objects or sound).
 
###Notes
The LAMP and WAMP (jargon) tools available for free online will help you complete requirement 1, as will Google’s Webserver project for the Raspberry Pi.
The website built for requirement 3 must satisfy both end user and legal expectations.
