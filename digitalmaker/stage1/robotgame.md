#Robot game

##Suggested activity

###Part 1: Program your Scout leader to make a jam sandwich 

Requirements: jam, butter, bread, knife, plate

The scout leader or other adult will be a robot, and the kids will give it instructions in order to make a jam sandwich.

The kids can use these words (to make instructions):

* Objects like bread slice, knife blade, knife handle, jam jar, jar lid, butter lid, butter tub, butter, plate, bread packet
* Actions like pick up, press down, put down, unscrew, remove, cut, spread, stop, put, hold, soft, hard, slow, fast, turn, top, bottom, repeat x times, left, right, hold, drop, raise, lower, scoop

* the kids need to write a series of instructions that only use the words provided. Each command must contain a left or right hand indicator. Eg "right hand pick up knife handle".
With younger pupils you can demo making a sandwich but don’t
use the commands.

* As the robot be pedantic and petty. Do exactly what pupils tell you even if it involves putting your hand in the butter or jam. When situations like this arise the kids should be encouraged to refine and debug their instructions as a normal part of computing.

* See the accompanying video to see common errors and examples
that are correct. Don’t show the videos to pupils. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leBEFaVHllE)

* Afterwards discuss what instructions worked well, what didn't and why.

###Part 2: Play a game with a friend where one of your acts the part of a robot and the other a user.

Record on paper what sort of commands worked best, and which were hard for the “robot” to follow.
