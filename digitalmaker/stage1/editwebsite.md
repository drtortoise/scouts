#Edit an existing website

##Suggested activity

*requirements: internet connection, a modern browser (like Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari). Pens and post-it notes.

Using either [Mozilla thimble](https://thimble.webmaker.org/) or [X-Ray Goggles](https://goggles.webmaker.org/)

There is an X Ray goggles chest sheet available at [https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/xray-goggles-cheatsheet](https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/xray-goggles-cheatsheet)

###Preparation

Make sure that your computers are set up with a modern web browser. The X-Ray Goggles are easy to install, but to save yourself a few minutes during your event or class, you can prep the computers by preinstalling the Goggles.

These activities and resources will help people learn basic concepts of HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language.

A markup language means that it is used to describe what things are. Even though the browser will try to display things as best as it can, it helps it to know what these things are. To tell browser that, we use tags.


##Human Tag Puzzle

* Prepare sets of tags on post-it notes. Include all of the tags that would be found in the structure of a standard web page (check out the example at http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp). Each post-it should include only one tag, like "<p>" with the related closing tag (say, "</p>") appearing on another post-it.

* Randomly assign post-its to participants. Everyone should get one tag.

* Ask participants to find the person who has the tag corresponding to their own. This means that the person holding "<p>" should find the person holding "</p>", the person holding "<h1>" should find the person with "</h1>", and so on.

Once participants have found their tag partners, ask them to have a brief chat about the possible meanings of their tags. What might "<h1>" do or mean? What purpose might "<body>" serve?

Now that we know a little bit about tags, we can start editing some web pages.

##test X-Ray Goggles
Follow the instructions on the website to replace the image. 

* copy the new image url
* click on the activate x ray googles
* click on the current image
* in the editor that opens up, replace the old url with the new url
* click save

###Remix any webpage!

You can take X-Ray Goggles with you anywhere on the web:

* Make sure your web browser's bookmarks bar is enabled.

* Drag the yellow "Activate X-Ray Goggles" button into your bookmarks bar, where it will automatically be added as a button that you can click to activate the Goggles on any webpage.

* Now visit any website on the internet. Activate the Goggles by clicking the new button in your bookmarks toolbar and start remixing!

Go to familiar websites like the BBC news (if you doing this activity with younger kids, I suggest checking out a kid-friendly website in advance and tell them to use that) and start replacing headlines, text and images with your own. If you want a random supply of kitten images I suggest using place kitten. http://placekitten.com/

##Edit a website using Mozilla thimble

Go to [https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/internet-defense-league](https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/internet-defense-league) and click on the remix button in the upper right corner. Now you'll have an editor on the left and the preview on the right. Try finding `<p>[INSERT YOUR NAME HERE]</p>` in the editor and write your name!
