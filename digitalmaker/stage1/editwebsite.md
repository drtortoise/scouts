###Remix any webpage!

You can take X-Ray Goggles with you anywhere on the web:

* Make sure your web browser's bookmarks bar is enabled.

* Drag the yellow "Activate X-Ray Goggles" button into your bookmarks bar, where it will automatically be added as a button that you can click to activate the Goggles on any webpage.

* Now visit any website on the internet. Activate the Goggles by clicking the new button in your bookmarks toolbar and start remixing!

Go to familiar websites like the BBC news (if you doing this activity with younger kids, I suggest checking out a kid-friendly website in advance and tell them to use that) and start replacing headlines, text and images with your own. If you want a random supply of kitten images I suggest using place kitten. http://placekitten.com/
