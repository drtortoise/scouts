#Game Design

### badge requirement

*  With a group of friends “pretend to be the game” by acting out how someone might play a game.
*  Using paper, prototype a game and explain to someone how it works. You could video this explanation.
* Evaluate and share what you created.

#Suggested activity

##Warm up - chat
* ask the group what are some games they know/play? What games do they like? What are their favourite playground games, board games, video games? What makes these games good? Why do they like playing them?

##Play a folk game 

Folk games are games that can be played with minimal equipment, aren't too legally or morally questionable to give away for free, and … well, they're not being transmitted orally here, but they could be in the future, and they mostly have been in the past.  for instance lemon joust, dodge the chair or human knot. What was your favourite playground game as a kid?

###How to play Lemon Joust 

* __Number of players:__ two or more 
* __Equipment:__ Every player should have two wooden spoons & one lemon.
* __Objective:__ Each player balances a lemon on one of their spoons, holding the spoon by end of the handle. Then they attempt to knock the lemons off their opponent's spoons. The last player with a lemon still on their spoon wins.

###How to play Dodge the Chair

* __Setup:__ Everyone holds hands in a giant circle, in the middle of the circle you put a chair.
* The group then tries to move players into the chair (while still holding hands) by running and pulling each other.
* When a player hits the chair, they leave the circle, the 2 people connected to them now join hands.
* The last person (or sometimes 2 people) to have not hit the chair win.

###How to play Human Knot

* __Setup:__ half the group holds hands, and then rolls up into a tight knot (by stepping over hands, crawling under people etc)
* The other half of the group has to try and get each person loose individually.
* The half that isn’t in the knot wins, by getting them loose.

After playing a folk game ask the group if the game was fun and why, if they know any similar games or better games.


##Invent a game and act it out

Divide the group into smaller groups, each group invents a game and acts it out

##Make a paper prototype

Using paper, prototype a game and explain to someone how it works. You could video this explanation.

If the kids have problems coming up with a game, or how to draw a story prototype, you could as a group look at how to turn a classic story like "Little red riding hood" into a video game.

1. Little Red Riding Hood walks through the woods to Grandma's house = classic player exploration. Give Red some goodies to collect to fill her picnic basket and have her jump over a fallen log or two
2. Red meets the big bad wolf = player has first enemy encounter
3. Carrying a full basic set of goodies, Red reaches Grandma's house (the next level) where she finds "grandma" waiting in bed
4. Red questions Grandma's true identity (quiz, puzzle)
5. Grandma is revealed to be the big bad wolf and the wolf and red battle (boss fight) 

###Some things to think about
a game is an activity that requires at least one __player__, has __rules__, and has a __victory condition__. A good game is easy to explain and has a clear objective. For instance the classic game Battleship's objective is "sink all your opponents ships".
